linking options that should help: -lglfw3 -lGL -lX11 -lpthread -lXrandr -lXi -ldl -lm -lXxf86vm -lXinerama -lXcursor -lrt


IMPORTANT - there is a big difference between -l and -L !!!!!! difference needs to be known!!!! do the changes to the windows system!!!

in the file, glad MUST be included before GLFW or you will get errors!!!
